# Course Registration Website

This repository contains the code for a simple two-page website designed for course registration. The site is created using HTML and features a straightforward interface for users to register for courses.

## Overview

The website consists of two pages:
1. **Registration Form Page**: Allows users to input their details and select courses.
2. **Confirmation Page**: Displays a summary of the registration details.

## Features

- **Two-Page Layout**: Clear separation between the registration form and confirmation page.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simplistic design for ease of use and navigation.
- **Basic HTML Structure**: Utilizes fundamental HTML elements for form handling and page layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages and forms.

## Customization

You can modify the content by editing `index.html` for the registration form and `confirmation.html` for the confirmation page.
